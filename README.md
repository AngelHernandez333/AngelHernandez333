# Hello, I'm Angel Hernandez! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Master's student in Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing at CINVESTAV, passionate about technology and always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects. My primary focus lies in the fields of **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **artificial intelligence**.

## About Me

- 👀 **Interests**: I'm interested in **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **artificial intelligence**.
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: I'm currently diving into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **AI agents**.

## My Projects

### Real-time Event Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks and Validation with Multimodal Large Language Models

📌 **This project is part of my Master's thesis and is currently a work in progress.**

This project seeks to develop a multi-frame-per-second convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for a multi-class detector capable of running efficiently on 'edge' processing platforms for real-time video analysis, to detect events. It also implements a fact-checking mechanism based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which analyze in detail the 'evidence' provided by the detector and decide whether it is a false positive or a real event.
