# Hello, I'm Angel Hernandez!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Master's student in Robotics at CINVESTAV, Skilled in Python programming with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence. My primary focus lies in the fields of **AI** and **computer vision**.

## About Me
- üî≠ **Currently Working On**: My Master's thesis on real-time event detection using multimodal AI systems
- üå± **Currently Learning**: I'm currently diving into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**.

## My Projects

### Real-time Event Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks and Validation with Multimodal Large Language Models

üìå **This project is part of my Master's thesis and is currently a work in progress.**

This project seeks to develop a conjunt architecture of MLLMs and multiclass detectors for video anomaly detection applications, to run in commercial GPUs in real time.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Tools & Technologies**: OpenCV, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Other Skills**: Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy), Git
